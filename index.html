            <p>The school life is the best life. Anyone who has been a student,</br>
                 knows what school life is all about: It is the golden period</br>
                  of learning and it truly impacts students’ lives. The importance </br>
                  of school life cannot be negated and it is a vital formative experience </br>
                  for children and adult students alike.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="lst_pragra">
            <p>School represents an important learning experience which teaches us</br>
                 self-confidence, motivation, and the will to always give our best.</br>
                  In addition, school blesses us with friends, many of whom remain</br>
                   with us for the rest of our life. School days really are the </br>
                   best days of our lives, and I have only good memories of my</br>
                    school days. For me, these days are like an invaluable treasure.</p>
